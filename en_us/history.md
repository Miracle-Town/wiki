## **2022.7.12 | Server Migration**
I am very happy that today we have migrated all data to the Shanghai node, which will effectively reduce the delay of the game and bring players a better gaming experience.

At the same time, the server configuration has also been updated, thank all players for their patience!

## **2022.6.22 | Company Formation**
**Today, our company was established!**

From now on, the legal operating body of Miracle Town will be changed to Hunan Arks Network Technology Co., Ltd. Any business that has been generated will continue to be performed without any impact; any user can continue to use all our services. For any previous works and creations produced by MT, the copyright belongs to Hunan Arks Network Technology Co., Ltd.

At the same time, due to the change of the legal subject, we have made changes to the RX Studio "Terms of Service" (https://www.rxgzs.cn/clause/ ) and "Privacy Policy" (https://www.rxgzs.cn/privacy/ ) Some revisions have been made, and the new terms will replace the old terms and have legal effect. Please read them carefully in time. When you continue to use any services we provide after this announcement, it means that you have carefully read and agreed to all the above terms.

I see how charming Qingshan is, and I expect Qingshan to see me like this. RX Studio will continue to work hard to produce high-quality works and build China's top UGC content team. Thank you for your continued support!

## **2022.6.12 | Week 2 opens**
This is another special day. After discussions with management and voting by players, we have officially decided:

**Open the second week! And the server version is upgraded to 1.18.2!**

## **2022.6.10 | Data Corruption**
Unfortunately, due to the previous series of operations, the existing data of MT has been sent, and the latest backup can only be restored to 4.3 days.

MT is going through the darkest period in history, I hope everyone can overcome the difficulties together with us.

The management group is currently negotiating a better solution.

We are considering upgrading to the new version of the ship 1.18, and opening the genuine verification on both sides to give you a better gaming experience.

For details, please move to group voting for arbitration.

Thank you again for **watching the storm and helping each other** with MT!
