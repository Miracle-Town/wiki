AntiCheatReloaded **requires** you to have ProtocolLib. You can download it [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/).
Simply drag and drop the AntiCheatReloaded and ProtocolLib jars in your plugin folder. You can now use AntiCheatReloaded, but be sure to have a look at the configuration files, which allow you to change every aspect of the plugin.
