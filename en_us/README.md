## **Meaning of Wiki**
Many times, some of the questions players ask are repetitive and pointless. (For example: "What is the official website address of the server?" "How do I join the server?" "What are the rules of the server?") Constantly answering these simple questions will not only waste time, but also cause a lot of damage to new players. barriers. The open sharing wiki will be the encyclopedia used by the entire server, and we expect it to provide everything you need to know as much as you want, and to support the development of an open sharing culture throughout the community.
